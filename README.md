# Tokenized Manufacturing Equipment Efficiency

## Overview

This repository contains a suite of smart contracts designed to track, measure, and optimize manufacturing equipment efficiency using blockchain technology. By tokenizing various aspects of manufacturing operations, we enable transparent, immutable records of equipment performance that can be used for data-driven maintenance decisions and operational improvements.

## Core Contracts

### Machine Registration Contract
Records essential details of production equipment including:
- Equipment specifications
- Installation date
- Location on production floor
- Operator credentials
- Expected operational parameters

### Performance Baseline Contract
Establishes standard operating metrics for comparison:
- Expected production rates
- Normal operational parameters
- Energy consumption benchmarks
- Quality standards
- Cycle time expectations

### Downtime Tracking Contract
Monitors and records unplanned equipment stoppages:
- Timestamp of incidents
- Duration of downtime
- Categorization of failure types
- Associated production losses
- Automated alerts and notifications

### Maintenance Impact Contract
Measures productivity changes following maintenance activities:
- Pre/post maintenance performance comparisons
- ROI calculations for service interventions
- Long-term efficiency trend analysis
- Predictive maintenance recommendations

## Implementation

These contracts are designed to interface with IoT sensors and manufacturing execution systems to gather real-time data. The blockchain implementation ensures data integrity while smart contract functionality automates analysis and reporting.

## Benefits

- Transparent equipment performance history
- Data-driven maintenance scheduling
- Quantifiable ROI on equipment service
- Immutable audit trail for compliance
- Foundation for predictive maintenance algorithms

## Getting Started

Please refer to the individual contract documentation for implementation details, required dependencies, and integration guides.
